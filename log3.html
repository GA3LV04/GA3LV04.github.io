	<h1>How does a CSS media query work, and why is it useful?</h1>

<p>A CSS media query is used to check things about a person's device, like the screen size or whether it's turned sideways. If those conditions match what's written in the code, the special styles are used, if not, they are skipped and this helps developers change how a website looks depending on the device. Media queries are overall useful because they make websites adjust automatically so they look good on phones, tablets, and computers.</p>

<h1>max-width</h1>

<p>This applies styles when the screen is a certain width or smaller.</p>

    <hr>

    <h1>min-width</h1>

<p>This applies styles when the screen is a certain width or larger.</p>

    <hr>

    <h1>orientation</h1>

 <p>This applies whether the device is being used in portrait (vertical) or landscape (horizontal) mode.</p>

    <hr>

    <h1>prefers-color-scheme</h1>

<p>This applies because it detects whether a user prefers light mode or dark mode on their device.</p>
